# Yet Another React Starter Project

There are many React starter projects around the Internet, but this one is mine.

I use this project to quickly setup my own React projects without the overhead of something like [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

Plus, it's nice to know how to setup the development and production build processes using tools like Babel and Webpack.

## To run

1. Clone this project onto your machine: `git clone https://github.com/daveschumaker/react-starter.git`
2. `cd react-starter`
3. `npm install`
4. Use `npm run dev` to start dev server or `npm run build` to create a production build in the `/dist` directory (you will need to use something like `serve` or `http-server` to run the production build from `dist`)
